## Hi, Iam Sharan

I kicked off my programming journey with **C++** in 11th grade, and let’s just say it wasn’t the smoothest ride—more like a roller coaster of confusion. I struggled, questioned my life choices, and then stumbled into **C**, hoping for something a little less dramatic. But then, **Python** swooped in like a superhero and made everything click! I dove into basic AI, and coding started to feel like a fun puzzle rather than a headache.

After surviving C and Python, I thought I was ready to face anything... until **Java** showed up. I tried to avoid it, like that one relative who always shows up uninvited. But then, I realized Java and **Scala** were basically twins—same DNA, just one with a bit more flair. They looked the same, acted the same, but Scala had the cool community and modern vibes that made me fall in love. It didn’t take long for me to embrace Scala, and now I'm exploring everything it has to offer.
